# libcurl examples on Outscale cloud
[![Project Archived](https://docs.outscale.com/fr/userguide/_images/Project-Archived-red.svg)](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Open-Source-Projects.html)

Curl and libcurl now supports AWSv4 signatures which allow Outscale users to use standard tools to make API requests.

Not every language has an SDK for Outscale API but you can use libcurl to ease your journey thanks to [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).

This repository shows how to use libcurl with [Outscale's API](https://docs.outscale.com/api.html) in different programming languages.

# Running examples

You will need:
- libcurl 7.75 or above
- An account on eu-west-2 region
- Setup your credentials through environment variables `OSC_ACCESS_KEY` and `OSC_SECRET_KEY`
